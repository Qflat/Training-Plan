PROJECT TITLE: HHP307

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Creates a running training program for a user based
on user inputs. 

VERSION or DATE: Version 1.0 uploaded to Github March 25 2020

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Read user instructions. 

AUTHORS: Jaden Costa

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Upon downloading and opening the HHP307.exe file, the
user will be promoted with a page asking for input for several different
questions. Once the user fills out each of these parameters, the user
presses the "Build My Program" button. The program will then write the 
training program and save the file as a Word document. The Word document
can be opened and viewed by the user to utilize as a tool for their 
training. 

If the HHP307.exe file is executed again, assuming the Word file is closed, 
the Word file will then be re-written to suit the new user's training 
program.
